### How to clone?

This repository includes submodule. Submodule is an app for `ex02` in `01_dockerfiles` part. It is used to demonstrate that created Dockerfile works correctly.

If you want to clone repository with submodule use:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository url>
```

If you will use `git clone <repository url>`, you will get the empty `app` folder in `01_dockerfiles/ex02`.
